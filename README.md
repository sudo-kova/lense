# Lense - View CS2 Nades through your Lense

Lense is a customizable quick reference guide for nade lineups in CS2. Each lineup contains two images: (1) the position of the player model (2) the position of the crosshair.

## Key Features
* The server is local and is not exposed to the internet, Lens relies on Python's HTTP web server
* Each map is divided into a 15 x 14 grid. Lineups are assigned to a "cell" in the grid.
* Cells that have lineups have a green accent
* Hovering over the green accent emphasizes it
* Lineups open in Modals
