# Lense - View CS2 Nades through your Lense

Lense is a html/css/js website served on localhost (port 8080) using pythons simple http server. Its purpose is to provide users with a custom quick reference guide that can be brought up between rounds in Steam's web browser. Nade lineups contain two images: (1) the position the player model throws the nade from (2) the crosshair lineup.
